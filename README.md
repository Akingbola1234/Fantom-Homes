# Inspiration behind FantomWorld

**Metaverse** is a virtual universe where people can interact with each other and digital objects in a three-dimensional (3D) immersive environment. FantomWorld inspiration came from the idea of having a real estate metaverse on the Fantom blockchain, where people can buy, sell and rent homes on the Metaverse.

But instead of narrowing it down to only homes, we decided why not make it a Metaverse World on the Fantom blockchain, where we won’t only be focusing on homes alone, but the whole necessities to make the world lively on the Metaverse on Fantom blockchain.

However, the team decided to start this amazing adventure with a marketplace, where homes, collections and lands that will be available in the FantomWorld Metaverse will be available to be bought, created by creators, and can be sold as well.

# What FantomWorld Does

FantomWorld is with a vision of bringing the Real World experience to the Metaverse on the Fantom Blockchain but we will be focusing on these and much more:

1. NFT Marketplace : FantomWorld is beyond just an NFT marketplace it is a world that we are creating on the metaverse, however the marketplace is where the buying and selling will be happening, homes will be bought, collections such as wearables etc and lands on the FantomWorld.
